# Monks_Revenge
This is our first game using assets from Locomalito's, "l'Abbaye des Morts."

We are using GameMaker as the creation engine. This project is a learning experience, not a commerical endevour.
The aim was to create platformer from start to finish, and using (and modifying) existing sprites allowed us to focus mostly
on the gameplay rather than asset creation.

The music and sound effects are original.
